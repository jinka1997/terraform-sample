Plan: 8 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Warning: Version constraints inside provider configuration blocks are deprecated

  on provider.tf line 2, in provider "azurerm":
   2:   version = "~> 2.0"

Terraform 0.13 and earlier allowed provider version constraints inside the
provider configuration block, but that is now deprecated and will be removed
in a future version of Terraform. To silence this warning, move the provider
version constraint into the required_providers block.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.
